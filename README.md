# Automata Library
Scala FMI Course Project
[Wiki automata theory] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory)

Present functionalities:
* Console interface
* Registration of automata 
(for every new automata a file with its name is created and it is serialized in text format there; names of already constructed automatas are stored in fileNames.txt)
* Check for word recognition
* Convert automata to format used for visualization with [Graphviz](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline)

Some possible improvements
* Add composing automatas functionality
* Add edit automata functionality
* Improve code quality
* Unit tests
