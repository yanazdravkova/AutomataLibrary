Scala FMI Course Project

-> Present functionalities:
Console interface
Registration of automata 
(for every new automata a file with its name is created and it is serialized in text format there; names of already constructed automatas are stored fileNames.txt_
Check for word recognition
Convert automata to format used for visualization with [Graphviz](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline)

-> Possible future improvements
Improve code quality
Add composing automatas functionality
Add edit automata functionality
Unit tests
